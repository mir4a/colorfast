According to [LEXICO](https://www.lexico.com/en/definition/colorfast) _colorfast_ is:

> Dyed in colors that will not fade or be washed out.

In fact, this tool will help developers to vanish all extra colors in a project
which supposed to be the same as _color schema_, but went uncontrollable during development.
Once I saw a project which had clear and strict color schema of about 16 colors,
but it turned out that project files contain over 200 variations of origin schema.
This is why _Colorfast_ was made.
